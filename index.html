        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding the distinctions between layoffs and retrenchments is
          crucial for both employers and employees. While both processes involve
          terminating employment, they serve different purposes and have varying
          implications. Layoffs provide a temporary solution with potential for
          reemployment, whereas retrenchments represent a permanent change in
          workforce structure aimed at enhancing organizational efficiency. The
          legal requirements surrounding each process are designed to protect
          employee rights while allowing businesses the flexibility needed to
          navigate economic challenges effectively.
